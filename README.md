# Hit Klack
Retro console game remake of Mephisto Hit Klack

This is an just for fun work in progress game remake. It`s based on a German console, the Hit Klack from Mephisto. Its runs on multiple platforms: Android, Windows, Linux, Mac. For me its a way to test the latest features of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), a programming language by [Jetrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It uses the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Java game development framework.
