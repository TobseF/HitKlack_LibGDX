  "body": "### Hitklack Game\r\nThis is an just for fun work in progress game remake. It`s based on a German console, the Hit Klack from Mephisto. Its runs on multiple platforms: Android, Windows, Linux, Mac. For me its a way to test the latest features of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), a programming language by [Jetrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It uses the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) Java game development framework.\r\n\r\n![Hitklack console and Android app](images/hitklack_console_and_app.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nFor now only one of the two console games is implemented: The Box Game. Features like, restart, level selection, a game over state, the clock and a manual are missing for now.\r\n\r\n## Box-Game manual\r\nIt`s your objective to build squares out of four lines. The lines are running automatically but can be stopped by pressing the corresponding button: To stop a line running from left, press red. If it`s falling down, press blue, and so on. If you finish one square you can go ahead with the next. The first line of a square can be stopped on any free field. The next three lines have to be stopped in the same square (ring). If a line will be stopped on wrong field, the current square and the last built square will be cleared.\r\n\r\n",
